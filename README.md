This repository aims to provide simple and basic examples on how to use pandas and geo-pandas for data analysis.

## Data management
This set of tools shows the basic functions for loading and viewing data sets coming from different sources such as:
* CSV:

Find examples for each of the previous data formats in the [data](data) folder.


## Libraries
All scripts have been tested using the following libraries.
